# Flagellar-Motor-Detection-in-Bacterial-Tomograms
## Understanding the Problem
Flagellar motors are macromolecular machines that drive bacterial motility
3D tomograms (tomographic reconstructions) contain these structures but they're hard to identify due to:
- Noise in the images
- Variable orientations
- Crowded cellular environments

  
# Application Functionality
Upload/load 3D tomographic data
View and interact with 3D data
Train ML models to detect flagellar motors
Visualize results of detection
Technical Implementation
For this application, I needed:

3D data visualization
Machine learning capabilities (TensorFlow.js would work in the browser)
Interactive UI for model training and visualization
Framework and Tools
TailwindCSS for responsive styling
Three.js for 3D visualization
TensorFlow.js for in-browser ML
Marked.js for any markdown documentation
Now, let's create a detailed plan for the application.

# App Plan
Create a responsive UI with:
Data upload/loading section
3D visualization canvas
Model training controls
Results visualization
Implement 3D tomogram visualization:
Volume rendering of 3D data
Interactive controls (rotate, pan, zoom)
Cross-sectional slicing
Implement ML model building:
Architecture selection (3D CNN would be appropriate)
Training parameter controls
Data augmentation options
Detection and visualization:
Highlight detected flagellar motors in the 3D view
Statistics on detections
Export capabilities
